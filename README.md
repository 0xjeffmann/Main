I am a dedicated professional with an interest in technology and a commitment to continuous learning and improvement. Recently completed the Google Cybersecurity Certificate program, along with certifications in Blockchain Basics and currently in progress of completing Solidity Smart Contract Fundamentals. I am seeking a position in IT/Cybersecurity or Blockchain to apply my skills in network security, security policy, blockchain development, and organizational risk management. With extensive knowledge in customer success, marketing & sales, critical thinking & analysis, and operations and systems, I bring effective communication skills and the ability to multitask. Humble and honest, I can adeptly manage through ambiguities and complexities.


## Objective

I am currently seeking to transition into the cybersecurity and blockchain industries, leveraging my diverse background and recent certifications in Cybersecurity, Blockchain Basics, and Solidity Smart Contract Development (in progress). My strengths in effective communication, adaptability, collaboration, attention to detail, and problem-solving, combined with a proven track record of success in interacting with professionals at all levels, position me well to contribute to roles in these emerging fields. I am eager to apply my skills and technical knowledge to securing digital assets and developing innovative blockchain solutions.
